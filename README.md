# SAM-assisted-RSI
SAM-Assisted Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images for River Pollution Recognition
>We propose an efficient semi-automated dataset construction pipeline that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model with powerful zero-shot segmentation capabilities. Our approach streamlines annotation by first using SAM to generate preliminary pseudo-labels, which then undergo minimal human refinement. 

Stay tuned, the code would be released once the paper were accepted.
